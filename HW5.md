### Summary of Hemingway's life

Ernest Hemingway, a man can be destroyed but not defeated.

Hemingway's life is so colorful as a writer, war correspondent, hunter, and winner of the 1954 Nobel Prize in literature. From his life route, it shows that he seems like a traveler in such a period of underdeveloped transport. Hemingway was born and raised up in Oak Park, Illinois, USA. Later, he went to Italy, Europe to take part in the world war I. In the following ten years, he tripped round the US and Europe. He wrote some books in Paris and Madrid in that period. Hemingway is also a hunter. One formal hunting experience was that he went to Africa in 1933 and wrote his hunting experience as a book in 1935. As for the last few routes, we could find Hemingway spent the rest of his life in the United States and Cuba. 

To some extent, his rich experiences contribute to his successful creation. I select three famous books of Hemingway and find the topics are highly related to his colorful personal events. For example, The Sun Also Rises (1926) tells a bullfighting story originated from his visiting the Festival of San Fermin in Pamplona, Spain, in 1923. Additionally, Green Hills of Africa (1935) tells his hunting experience in Africa. 

As for his whole life of writing, I agree that Hemingway is a true writer. From the n-grams and sentiment analysis of his three representative books, I find each book is a new beginning where he tries for something that is beyond attainment. His writing style is corresponding to his adventurous lifestyle, since he mainly use strong words, and the thoughts are positive in most of his books. Indeed, Hemingway's concise and direct writing style greatly influences on later writers. He seldom uses decorative words, but tells stories of courage, strength and dignity that some people have shown in life in short words.

Overall, Hemingway is a veritable hero in American literature and even in the history of world literature.
